this project has made me despise langchain

# how to test:

should do this:

```
from fred import Fred
```

<!-- install my project in editable mode w dev dependencies, so changes are live -->

python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

<!-- to do: force use of vscode and ruff formatter -->
<!-- to do: gpg key or whatever to verify on GitHub -->
