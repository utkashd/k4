# Thoughts about MCP

- late 2024 anthropic shared
  [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
- it works afaik
- but it potentially has a usability issue (I admittedly have not used MCPs
  enough to say). client-side has to configure everything. + you're limited to
  what the mcp server offers. What if you wanted to configure an action that
  combines/compounds tools, and didn't want to set that up on *every* client you
  might have(so pre-configuring for non-technical users)
